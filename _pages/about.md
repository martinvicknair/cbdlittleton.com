<p>CBD American Shaman's nanotechnology empowers us to share the most powerful and effective hemp oil with the world. All CBD American Shaman products contain less than 0.3% THC,<em> far below the level at which THC is psychoactive, and absolutely won't get you high</em>. Our Full Spectrum and Broad Spectrum products which contain this tiny level of THC help you harness the beneficial "entourage effect" of cannabinoids working in concert. We also produce Zero THC products to comply with state laws that prohibit any level of THC.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CBD is short for cannabidiol, which is one of the naturally-occurring substances found in the cannabis plant. CBD is just one of the cannabinoids present in cannabis, and it is known for its relief and wellness properties. It is extracted from the hemp plant and diluted with a carrier oil to meet the desired dose. CBD oil can be made into a tincture which is taken under the tongue, a topical serum which is used on the skin, or a water soluble that dissolves in water or any other drink. CBD is also infused into edible products or made into capsules for other methods of consumption.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you plan to take CBD daily, we recommend starting with 5mg twice daily. This is equal to one full mL dropper daily, split into two doses of half the dropper. If you do not feel the resulting relief from discomfort, slowly increase your daily dose to a level that provides you the results you are looking for. Results may vary from person to person.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CBD may provide relief from discomfort as well as manage occasional stress and promote joint flexibility and cartilage function. Our CBD products are not intended to treat or cure any diseases, but rather to provide general health support physically and mentally. Since CBD may provide relief for mild discomfort and supports joint health, many people use CBD to promote healthy joint function. Results may vary from person to person, and we recommend starting with a low daily dose and working up to a dose that suits your needs.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CBD oil may provide relief from mild discomfort, promote relaxation, help manage everyday stress, and provide relief from occasional sleeplessness. It also may provide positive mental support, help improve mood, help maintain cardiovascular function, and help promote joint flexibility. CBD American Shaman lab tests all products for purity and potency standards. So, if you want one of the most pure and potent products available, try one of ours.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a large variety of different types of products in our relief category, so it’s understandable if you’re having a hard time deciding which product to try. It really depends on your preference. Oil tinctures and water solubles are an efficient way to take CBD daily for relief, but our gummies or edible products are a tastier option. Or, for topical relief, use one of our topical creams or serums. Try a few and see which products you like best!</p>
