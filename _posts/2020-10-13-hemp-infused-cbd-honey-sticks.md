<p><a href="https://cbdamericanshaman.com/littleton/cbd-honey">CBD honey</a> is a natural sweetener infused with hemp extract. The full-spectrum CBD hemp oil is extracted from the hemp plant, then infused into the honey. We then package our CBD honey into sticks for convenient use of one serving at a time. Edible products are many people’s favorite way to take CBD. Rather than using an oil tincture or water soluble product, edible products are a tastier way to consume CBD. </p>

<p>Our CBD infused honey sticks are the perfect way to add wellness to your favorite drinks or snacks. We harvest raw honey from Cooper’s honey, located in Missouri. Honey has been known to provide health benefits for centuries and acts as an effective carrier for our high quality, terpene rich CBD oil. </p>

Each honey stick contains 10mg of Full-Spectrum CBD. Our honey sticks are a convenient way to get the benefits of CBD wherever you go!</p>
